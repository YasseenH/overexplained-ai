Write a daily newsletter about: ${topic}

Create a newsletter article that follows this EXACT structure with these EXACT markers:

**TITLE**: Write a compelling, question-based headline like "What Is [Topic] and How Does It Work?" or "How Does [Topic] Actually Work?" Make it curiosity-driven and specific.

**INTRO**: Write 2-3 sentences that hook the reader and clearly state what they'll learn and why it matters.

**UNDERSTANDING**: Write 2-3 paragraphs explaining the basics. Start with "What is [topic]?" and break down how it works in simple terms using analogies and real-world examples.

**REAL LIFE**: Write 1-2 paragraphs with concrete examples and scenarios that people can relate to in their daily lives.

**DID YOU KNOW**: Write 2-3 paragraphs with fascinating facts, historical context, and surprising applications. Use "Did you know..." and "Here's the fascinating part..." to introduce facts.

**WHERE WE SEE THIS**: Write 1-2 paragraphs about practical applications and real-world use cases that make the topic relevant to everyday life.

**KEY TAKEAWAY**: Write 1 clear, memorable sentence that summarizes the main learning.

Requirements:
- Length: 800-1200 words (5-8 minute read)
- Tone: Conversational, curious, and engaging - like explaining to a smart friend
- Language: Simple enough for a high school student to understand
- Examples: Use concrete, relatable analogies and real-world scenarios
- Structure: Follow the EXACT markers above - no variations

Writing Style:
- Use clear, direct language and avoid complex terminology
- Aim for a Flesch reading score of 80 or higher
- Use the active voice
- Avoid adverbs
- Do not use m-dashes or em-dashes
- Avoid AI markers or overly formal language
- Avoid buzzwords and instead use plain English
- Use jargon only where relevant and immediately explain it
- Avoid being salesy or overly enthusiastic and instead express calm confidence
- Write like a knowledgeable friend explaining something fascinating
- Keep sentences concise and paragraphs focused
- Use "Think of it like..." for analogies that make complex ideas simple
- Include "Here's the fascinating part..." for interesting facts
- End with "The bottom line is..." for key takeaways

Formatting Rules:
- Do NOT start any paragraph with a colon (:)
- Do NOT use bold formatting in the content text
- Only use the EXACT section markers listed above
- Use plain text for all content paragraphs
- Do NOT use bullet points (- or â€¢) anywhere in the content
- Write all content as flowing paragraphs, even for lists of facts
- Ensure clean paragraph breaks between sections
- Each section should flow naturally from one paragraph to the next

Remember: This should feel like a daily dose of fascinating knowledge that readers look forward to with their morning coffee. Make complex topics feel accessible and exciting while maintaining a calm, confident tone. Write everything as natural paragraphs, not as lists or bullet points.`;
